### Hi there 👋

My name is Charli and welcome to my Github!

### My Research
I am a PhD student in the [Cell and Molecular Biology Department](https://cmb.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University. My research is in the [Stenglein lab](https://www.stengleinlab.org/) studying the mechanisms of bunyavirus reassortment and viral protein interactions. 🦟🦠

Previously, I received my B.S in Microbiology from CSU while researching the [neurotoxic effects of acute *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection](10.3389/fragi.2023.1244149).

I am also very passionate about all things entomology 🐝🦗🦋🕷️
